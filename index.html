<br>
How Workknot works? <br>
<br>
The Workknot App, which can run on Android Devices, consists of a well-designed user interface which provides multiple options (on its Home screen) which can be selected to hire or connect to different types of temporary Workers (like Mason, Electrician, etc.) based on their availability in your City or Area (You can opt for your city too). Choosing one of the given options will direct you to a list of Names of the Workers in the same field which you opted for. Choosing any of the Names, You will be redirected to the Worker's Profile where you can see their Name and Contact Number. You can directly call them by tapping on the "Tap to Call" option on the same window. "Tap to Call" will redirect you to your Device Dialler or Caller. Here, your communication will be completely between you and the Worker you called, just like in the ordinary case. We will not be Tapping or Recording or Interfering with Your call.
Similarly, you can also contact Construction Dealers through sliding down the app window and clicking on several slides in the "Buy Construction Products" area.<br>
The top-left icon consist of right-sliding Menu where You can see other options viz. 'Home' (to go on Home window), 'Profile' (to see Your Workknot Profile), 'About Us' (to know about Us), 'Need Help?' (to ask for Our help), 'Terms & Conditions' (to read T&C), 'Join Workknot' (to join Workknot as a Workker) and 'Logout'(to logout from Workknot App). <br>
<br>
